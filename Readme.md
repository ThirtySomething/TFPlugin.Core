# Weatherstation

This project will address a [Tinkerforge weather station][TFURL]. There are
  - The client for reading the data of the weather station.
  - The server for dealing with the data in form of saving them, historize them and compress them somehow.
  - The UI for displaying the data processed by the server.

## ToDos

- Remember to remove [M2MqttDotnetCore][NGMQTT] NuGet package at client before publish
- Improve MQTT plugin to handle not acknowledged data.
- Implement server part, consists of
  - Writing data to database (MySQL, MariaDB, ...)
  - Implement a [swinging door algorithm][SDoor] for historizing/compressing the data.
  - Create a HTML frontend with various information
    - Data of current values
    - Historized data
    - Graphics

## Notes for myself

- Is the swinging door a good algorithm to be used for weather data?
- What about [rrdtool](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRDtool)?
- What about [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)?
- What about [opentsdb](http://opentsdb.net/)?
